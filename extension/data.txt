Nuremberg:
Nuremberg is a server founded in May of 2020. Many longtime members of this server originate from Nuremberg.
Although originally created by maitreya, it was eventually handed to Totally due to her lack of activity. Once Totally felt he no longer wanted to manage it, he gave it to Dante.
This server was unique in that it had a semi-functioning democratic leadership with elected moderators. However, many well-liked members maintained seats of power even though they did nothing.
Due to a slow decrease in activity, Totally changed the name and theme of the server, but it had the adverse effect of destroying activity on the server.
Due to this and prior complaints, a crackdown on edgy and fringe humor continued until many original members left to other places. Dante, seeing its lack of activity, shut it down.
